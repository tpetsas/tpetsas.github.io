Computer Science
-----------


I hold a B.Sc. ('09) and a M.Sc. ('12) degree in Computer Science from the Computer Science Department ([CSD][]) at the
University of Crete ([UOC][]), Greece. During my studies I had the opportunity to work on several research projects in the
wide area of networking and distributed systems, focusing mostly on Mobile Security.

I worked as a Research Assistant (2009--2012) and R&D Engineer (2012--2015) at the Distributed Computing Systems
Laboratory ([DCS][]) of Institute of Computer Science ([ICS][]), at the Foundation for Research and Technology, Hellas ([FORTH][]).
In 2016, I joined **[Appthority][]**, a Mobile Security company in San Francisco, focusing on enterprise threat protection. While
on Appthority, I worked on static and dynamic analysis of Android applications. Recently, I joined **[Symantec][]** through the
Appthority acquisition (2018) and I am part of the Modern OS Security team.

Photography
----------

I like taking photographs as well as watching the work of other photographers.
One of my favorites is [Ragnar Axelsson][]. I also enjoy watching photostreams
on Flickr. I have found some of them that are really exciting. One is the
photostream of [Manolis Skantzakis aka "skantzman"][skantzman]. I love his perspective
and the most of his photoseries especially the "Lost Childhood" one. Another
one photostream I like is this of [George Kamelakis][kamelman]. His photos are really
bizzare. What I like most of his work is his fascinating portraits.
I also love travel photography! One person I admire on this is [Stylianos Papardelas][pap].

I used to be a member of the Photography club of the University of Crete ([**FOPK**][fopk]).
I have a photostream too (no longer maintained), you can find it [here][myFlickr].
